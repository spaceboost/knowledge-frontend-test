[Spaceboost](https://www.spaceboost.com) Knowledge Test for frontend developers.

## Getting started

To build the user interface we use an open-source progressive 
JavaScript framework called [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Alongside Vue.js
we use [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) as our material design style 
framework. We use [REST API](https://reqres.in/) as a hosted Rest-API
to respond the requests. 

## Goals

To pass this practice we must to:

1. Create a signup page.

2. Create a login page.

3. Craete a user table list.

4. Allow to paginate user table list.

5. Allow to create new user.

6. Allow to edit user.

7. Allow to delete user.

8. Unit testing.

9. Create custom error pages (404, 403, 500)

10. Question: What would you do if you had more time?
